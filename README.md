# Mathematical Discovery Pipeline 🧮

An AI-powered platform that automates the process of mathematical discovery, verification, and paper generation. This system combines advanced pattern analysis with formal verification to help explore and validate new mathematical conjectures.

## 🌟 Features

- **Interactive Discovery Interface**: User-friendly web interface for inputting mathematical queries
- **Multi-Stage Pipeline**:
  - Initial Curiosity Analysis
  - Pattern Recognition & Analysis
  - Automated Discovery
  - Formal Proof Validation
  - Paper Generation
  - arXiv Publication Preparation
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Dynamic progress tracking through each pipeline stage
- **Verification Reports**: Detailed validation of discovered patterns and proofs
- **Peer Review System**: Automated review process for quality assurance
- **PDF Paper Generation**: Automatic generation of publication-ready papers
- **Mathematical Animations**: Beautiful loading animations with mathematical formulas

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites 


## 🔧 Usage

1. Enter your mathematical query in the input field
